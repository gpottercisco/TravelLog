    <h2 id="fullstory">A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
    <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>

    <h3 id="day1">Day 1</h3>
    <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em></p>

    <h3 id="day2">Day 2</h3>
    <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.</p>
    <p>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate
       all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.</p>

    <h3 id="day3">Day 3</h3>
    <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum
       also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
